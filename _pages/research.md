### The Nordic Word order Database
The [Nordic Word Order Database](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nwd) (NWD) is a collaboration between researchers from the University of Oslo and UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The online database contains carefully elicited production from the five North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish.
Two main experiments were run to collect production data of phenomena that are known to show syntactic variation. The first experiment focusses on argument placement, the second experiment on verb placement. The experimental paradigms were developed by Ida Larsson (exp. 1), Bj√∂rn Lundquist (exp. 1 and 2) and Maud Westendorp (exp. 2). The process of building the Nordic Word order Database (NWD) and the data collection for this project is detailed in [Lundquist et al. 2019](https://journals.uio.no/NALS/article/view/7529). [A repository](http://github.com/maudwestendorp/NWD) that includes test material, experiment scripts, and analysis scripts and guidelines is available on my GitHub.
