Projects I have developed / been apart of. 

### The Nordic Word order Database
The [Nordic Word Order Database](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nwd) (NWD) is a collaboration between researchers from the University of Oslo and UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The freely available online database contains carefully elicited production from the five North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish. Two main experiments were run to collect production data of syntactic constructions that are known to show variation between or within the North Germanic languages. The first experiment focusses on argument placement, the second experiment on verb placement. The experimental paradigms were developed by Ida Larsson (exp. 1), Björn Lundquist (exp. 1 and 2) and Maud Westendorp (exp. 2). The process of building the Nordic Word order Database (NWD) and the data collection for this project is detailed in [Lundquist et al. 2019](https://journals.uio.no/NALS/article/view/7529). [A repository](http://github.com/maudwestendorp/NWD) that includes test material, experiment scripts, and analysis scripts and guidelines is available on my GitHub.


### Mini-corpus: Word order variation in wh-questions in Sogn Norwegian
In collaboration with Øystein A. Vangsnes, I have created a corpus of wh-questions in Sogn Norwegian. Production data was collected between 2003 and 2005 from 22 unique speakers in two location in the region of Sogn og Fjordane, Western Norway (i.e., Sogndal and Gaupne). A dataset of 700 wh-questions, fully annotated and tagged was constructed. A discussion and analysis of this material and some of the patterns found in this data can be found in [this unpublished manuscript](https://uitno.box.com/s/lyh11aexo79esxurewh9f56n72otft9d) and [this RMarkdown file](https://uitno.box.com/s/5tqerslweiwfnrre2o2z5mm6hk2my69g).
