I have recently completed my PhD in Linguistics at UiT The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. I was co-advised by Björn Lundquist and Øystein Vangsnes, and affiliated with the [Formal Investigations into Structure and Hierarchy](https://site.uit.no/castlfish/) research group at CASTL, the [Center for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics](https://site.uit.no/castl/). Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the project [Multilectal Literacy in Education](https://www.hvl.no/en/multilit) which studies multilectally individuals, i.e. language users that have the capacity to write (and read) in different closely related linguistic codes, adressing questions on cognitive/academic development and language seperation. I am also a member of the Scientific Research Network "Re-examining dialect syntax" funded by Flanders Research Foundation (FWO).

My primary interests lie in (experimental approaches to) syntactic variation. In my dissertation I considered different ways the Verb Second rule breaks down in Norwegian (e.g., V3-triggering preverbal adverbs, non-V2 wh-questions, and embedded Verb Second). I also took a comparative look at verb placement across the North Germanic languages. My dissertation can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/10037/24398).

I am Dutch, and before studying at UiT I completed my BA in Linguistics (specialisation: Language & Cognition) at Leiden University, and my MARes in Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. When I’m not doing linguistics, you can find me speed skating at the local ice rink, playing disc golf or planning my next hike.
