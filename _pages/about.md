I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Linguistics at UiT The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. I am co-advised by Björn Lundquist and Øystein Vangsnes, and I am affiliated with the [Formal Investigations into Structure and Hierarchy](https://site.uit.no/castlfish/) research group at CASTL, the [Center for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics](https://site.uit.no/castl/). 

My primary interests lie in experimental approaches to linguistic variation. My dissertation considers the different ways the North Germanic Verb Second rule breaks down in Norwegian dialects and the other North Germanic languages (V3-triggering preverbal adverbs, non-V2 wh-questions, and embedded verb second). 

I am a member of the Scientific Research Network "Re-examining dialect syntax" funded by Flanders Research Foundation (FWO) and part of the project "Variation and Change in the Scandinavian Verb Phrase" funded by Research Council of Norway (NFR) and University of Oslo. 

I am Dutch, and before studying at UiT I completed my BA in Linguistics (major: Language & Cognition) at Leiden University, and my MARes in Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. When I’m not doing linguistics, you can find me speed skating at the local ice rink, baking bread or planning my next hike.
