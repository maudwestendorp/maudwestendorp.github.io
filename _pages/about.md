I have recently defended my PhD in Linguistics at UiT The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. I was co-advised by Björn Lundquist and Øystein Vangsnes, and I am affiliated with the [Formal Investigations into Structure and Hierarchy](https://site.uit.no/castlfish/) research group at CASTL, the [Center for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics](https://site.uit.no/castl/). 

My primary interests lie in (experimental approaches to) syntactic variation. In my dissertation I considered different ways the Verb Second rule breaks down in Norwegian (e.g., V3-triggering preverbal adverbs, non-V2 wh-questions, and embedded verb second). I also take a comparative look at verb placement across the North Germanic languages. My dissertation can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/10037/24398).

I am a member of the Scientific Research Network "Re-examining dialect syntax" funded by Flanders Research Foundation (FWO) and part of the project "Variation and Change in the Scandinavian Verb Phrase" funded by Research Council of Norway (NFR) and University of Oslo. 

I am Dutch, and before studying at UiT I completed my BA in Linguistics (major: Language & Cognition) at Leiden University, and my MARes in Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. When I’m not doing linguistics, you can find me speed skating at the local ice rink, baking bread or planning my next hike.
